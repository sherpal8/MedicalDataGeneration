This is a synthetic data generator.

The objective is to create data so that developers may proceed with the development of medical tech applications without needing access to actual sensitive patient data. Therefore, medtech developers can move on to prototype development to quickly ascertain project viability.

The synthetic data being generated are:

- Nursing Observations
- Temperature (in Â°Celcius)
- Urine Output (ml/hour)
- Blood glucometer sugar levels (mmol/L)
- Biochemical markers - including Urea and Electrolytes, Liver Function Tests
- Blood counts and microscopy

In general, most human markers are of a parametric character (i.e. with a normal distribution). However, some may be of a more ordinal nature (i.e. ranking based on more subjective assessments). Therefore, there is often some sort of linear-order, even if these relationships can wildly multi-dimensional and complex. Also, the data should be available in variety of time-serialised manner, whilst respecting the documented extremes in human physiological values.

It is of hope that this will be phase-1 of an ongoing project. Eventually, the aim is to create a proptotype that utilises machine learning to make rapid moment-by-moment clinical decicisions. Also, to help supplement as well as justify clinical decision making, thereby preventing litigation and making decision-making more trasparent epsecially for the most vulnerable.

It is also possible that machine learning can be used to provide healthcare in isolated, overtly rural, and dangerous places where it is difficult to deploy sufficient numbers of qualified doctors. Perhaps, this may help achieve WHO's commitment to improving global access to quality heathcare.
