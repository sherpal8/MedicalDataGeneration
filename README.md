This is a mock health data generator.

The objective is to create mock data so that companies may proceed to development of applications without needing access to actual real patients data.

The data being generator are:

- Nursing Observations
- Temperature
- Blood sugar levels

It is if hope that this will be Phase 1 of an ongoing project. To create a proptotype that utilises machine learning to make rapid moment-by-moment clinical decicisions. Also, to help supplement as well as justify clinical decisions.
