This is a mock health data generator.

The objective is to create synthetic data so that developers may proceed with the development of medical tech applications without needing access to actual patient data. Therefore, budding medtech entrepreeurs can circumvent the need for bureaucratic redtape with actual patient access to develop prototypes.

The synthetic data being generated are:

- Nursing Observations
- Temperature
- Blood sugar levels
- Biochemical markers - including Urea and Electrolytes, Liver Function Tests
- Blood counts and microscopy

The beauty of a lot of human parameters and markers, is in its parametric character (with a normal distribution) or at least its ordinal character (i.e. ranking). Therefore, there is some sort of linear-relationship even if these relationships can multi-dimensional and complex.

It is of hope that this will be Phase-1 of an ongoing project. Eventually, the aim is to create a proptotype that utilises machine learning to make rapid moment-by-moment clinical decicisions. Also, to help supplement as well as justify clinical decisions.
